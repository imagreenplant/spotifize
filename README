Spotifizer

A commandline utility to allow one to "spotifize" a poem.  The utility will search for songs whose titles match the lyrics within a submitted poem.  For instance, inputting a text file whose contents are "You Can't Always Get What You Want" will likely return the same song from the Rolling Stones, and a link to it.  This utility will search by-line, and by-word.

Some features:
- A best effort duration limiter, upon reaching the limit will grab what results it already has and spit them out
- Multiple threads for making multiple requests to the spotify metadata API
- Match weighting, to allow tweaks to which types of matches are created.
- Reads in from a file or text input at the commandline.
- Can be easily converted to a lib

Usage:
python poem.py -f <testfile.txt>
